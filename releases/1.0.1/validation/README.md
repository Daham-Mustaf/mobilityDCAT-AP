# 🔍 Introduction to SHACL

## 🎯 What is SHACL and Why Use It?

SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. It is used to:

1. Define the structure of RDF data
2. Validate RDF data against predefined shapes
3. Data quality assurance

## 🔄 Why OWL is Not Enough

While OWL (Web Ontology Language) is powerful for defining ontologies and inferring new knowledge, it has limitations:

1. OWL operates under the Open World Assumption, making it challenging to validate data completeness
2. OWL lacks built-in support for certain validation tasks, like cardinality checks on properties
3. OWL is designed for inferencing, not for data validation

SHACL complements OWL by providing a robust framework specifically for data validation and integrity constraints.

## 🌐 Open World vs. Closed World
For a detailed technical explanation of these concepts, see: [Open World vs. Closed World Assumptions in Knowledge Representation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/open-world-assumption)

1. **Open World Assumption (OWA)**:
   - Used in OWL
   - Assumes that what is not explicitly stated might be true
   - Good for knowledge representation and inferencing
   - Challenging for data validation

2. **Closed World Assumption (CWA)**:
   - Used in SHACL
   - Assumes that what is not explicitly stated is false
   - Better suited for data validation and constraint checking
   - Allows for more stringent data quality control

SHACL's use of CWA makes it more appropriate for scenarios where you need to ensure data completeness and adherence to a specific structure.

## 💡 Key Takeaway

SHACL provides a standardized, powerful way to validate RDF data, filling gaps left by OWL and other Semantic Web technologies. Its closed-world approach makes it particularly useful for ensuring data quality and completeness in various applications, from data integration.


# 🔍 SHACL Basics (Core) and Advanced Features

## 🌱 SHACL Basics (Core Features)

SHACL Core provides the fundamental constraints and validation mechanisms. Here are the key components, for more detail see: [Core Constraint Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#core-components)

1. **Node Shapes**
   - Define constraints that apply to nodes in the data graph.
   - Example: `sh:NodeShape` to define a shape for a specific class of nodes.

2. **Property Shapes**
   - Define constraints on properties and their values.
   - Example: `sh:PropertyShape` to define constraints on a specific property.

3. **Cardinality Constraints**
   - Control the number of values a property can have.
   - Examples: `sh:minCount`, `sh:maxCount`

4. **Value Type Constraints**
   - Specify the allowed types for property values.
   - Examples: `sh:datatype`, `sh:class`, `sh:nodeKind`

5. **Value Range Constraints**
   - Define allowed ranges for numeric and date values.
   - Examples: `sh:minInclusive`, `sh:maxExclusive`

6. **String Constraints**
   - Constrain string values using patterns or length.
   - Examples: `sh:pattern`, `sh:minLength`, `sh:maxLength`

7. **Logical Constraints**
   - Combine constraints using logical operators.
   - Examples: `sh:and`, `sh:or`, `sh:not`

8. **Shape References**
   - Reference other shapes within a shape definition.
   - Example: `sh:node` to reference another shape

9. **Targeting Rules**
   - Specify which nodes in the data graph a shape applies to.
   - Examples: `sh:targetClass`, `sh:targetNode`

10. **Result Properties**
    - Customize validation result messages.
    - Example: `sh:message` for custom violation messages

## 📝 Notes

- SHACL Core is sufficient for many common validation scenarios and is widely supported.
- SHACL Advanced features provide more flexibility but may have limited support in some tools.
- When using advanced features, consider compatibility with your chosen SHACL engine.
- Combining multiple features can create powerful validation rules but may also increase complexity.
- Always test your shapes thoroughly, especially when using advanced features, to ensure they behave as expected.

Remember, while SHACL Advanced offers powerful capabilities, it's often best to start with SHACL Core and only use advanced features when necessary for your specific use case.


# 📚 SHACL Shape Prefixes

This document lists the prefixes used in the SHACL shapes for the [mobilityDCAT-AP](https://mobilitydcat-ap.github.io/mobilityDCAT-AP/releases/index.html) Application Profile.

| Prefix | IRI |
|--------|-----|
| : | `http://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap#` |
| mobilitydcatap | `http://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap#` |
| adms | `http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#` |
| bibo | `http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/` |
| cnt | `http://www.w3.org/2011/content#` |
| dcat | `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#` |
| dcatap | `http://data.europa.eu/r5r/` |
| dct | `http://purl.org/dc/terms/` |
| dqv | `http://www.w3.org/ns/dqv#` |
| foaf | `http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/` |
| org | `http://www.w3.org/ns/org#` |

| sh | `http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#` |
| xsd | `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#` |

## 📝 Notes

- The `:` prefix and `mobilitydcatap` prefix both refer to the same IRI (`http://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap#`). This is likely for convenience, allowing both a shorthand (`:`) and a more descriptive prefix for the same namespace.
- These prefixes cover a wide range of vocabularies and standards used in semantic web technologies, including:
  - DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)
  - Dublin Core Terms
  - FOAF (Friend of a Friend)
  - SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
  - OWL (Web Ontology Language)
  - SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)
  - XML Schema
- Some prefixes are specific to certain domains or applications, such as `bibo` for bibliographic ontology and `vcard` for contact information.

## 🔧 Usage

When working with SHACL shapes or RDF data using these vocabularies, you can use these prefixes to shorten IRIs. For example, instead of writing:

```turtle
<http://w3id.org/mobilitydcat-ap#someProperty> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectProperty> .
```

You can write:

```turtle
mobilitydcatap:someProperty rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
```

This makes the data more readable and easier to manage.

  - Community support and documentation

- For production use, it's often best to use a well-established library like Apache Jena (Java) or pySHACL (Python).

- Online playgrounds are great for quick tests and learning, but for sensitive data or large-scale validation, a local implementation is usually more appropriate.

- Some of these tools may have additional features beyond basic SHACL validation, such as inference support or integration with other semantic web technologies.
