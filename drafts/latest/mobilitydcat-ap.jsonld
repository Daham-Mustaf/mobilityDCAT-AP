For data services, e.g., API, broker services, data feeds, etc., the URL MAY be the end point of such service. However, if some agreements between the data provider and the data user need to be established first, the access URL may link to web page, where the access is further arranged, e.g., initiating a a subscription process. For data which can be downloaded directly, the download URL should be copied from the optional property dcat:downloadURL. For other cases, where data cannot be directly accessed or downloaded via the platform, the access URL MAY be a link to an external service or a website which enables access to the data. This way, this property is the primary key to link to a data service. There is also specific class dcat:DataService, which can be linked via property dcat:accessService.
