<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document contains version 1.0 of the specification for mobilityDCAT-AP, an extension of the DCAT application profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) [[DCAT-AP]]. It allows for a structured, interoperable and haarmonised way to describe and exchange metadata about datasets and data services with a mobility relevance. Its basic use case is to make such datasets and services searchable on data portals with a mobility focus, thereby making mobility information better findable across borders and sectors. </p>

<p>For this purpose, mobilityDCAT-AP provides an RDF vocabulary and the corresponding RDF syntax, as originally defined by [[DCAT-AP]], but it is extended and customised to the mobility sector.</p>


<section id="context">

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Digitalisation in the mobility domain often involves making various data from various actors discoverable and accessible. Accordingly, internet portals for mobility data have been developed all over the world in recent years. They often have a specific spatial coverage and/or a specific thematic coverage, e.g., showing public transport data for one region. In addition, legal obligations to set up and populate such portals have been established, e.g., in the European Union via the National Access Points (NAPs) [[NAPCORE-NAPs]]. </p>

<p>Metadata are a crucial building block for accessibility and reusability of datasets in NAPs and other mobility data portals. However, a common metadata approach across different mobility portals has not been established yet, unlike in other domains such as bibliography. A common metadata approach can ease and harmonise data accessibility and exchange, thus enhancing the efficiency of individual mobility data portals. To proceed with metadata harmonisation, a dedicated Working Group within the EU-cofunded project [[NAPCORE-Metadata-Working-Group]] is taking care of the definition and maintenance of a common metadata schema for all NAPs in Europe, but also for any mobility data portals. </p>

<p>Starting from the analysis of the European recommendations for the interoperability of data catalogues, the Working Group has defined a roadmap for the design, implementation and publication of the metadata schema. The roadmap is composed of five steps: collection of requirements from experts and transportation stakeholders, definition of the conceptual model, implementation, documentation and guidelines, hosting and publication. The conceptual modal, containing definitions of essential metadata elements for mobility data portals, allows for precisely and unambiguously designating a mobility dataset, e.g. for representing the data topic, the data provider or the data format. Further, this model wass linked to established, metadata specifications, namely DCAT-AP. Moreover, a formal metadata specification was elaborated as an extension to DCAT-AP, called mobilityDCAT-AP. </p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP allows harmonised, platform-independent metadata descriptions in human-readable and machine-readable formats. The latter one allows for an automated import and export of metadata with 3rd parties via an API, for example. Analogous to DCAT-AP, the specification is based on a Resource Description Framework (RDF) schema, being an enabler for semantic technologies. This facilitates, for example, enhanced queries about the metadata, or a deduction of additional information from the metadata. After its first release in summer 2023, this specification is being promoted for wide-scale usage in mobility data portals. For improved acceptance and sustainability, formal maintenance and governance structures were also established for mobilityDCAT-AP. Lastly, the common approach is an input for a planned cross-border metadata registry, resulting in a planned demonstrator and proof-of-concept for mobilityDCAT-AP.</p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP is suitable for precisely and unambiguously designating metadata of any data offering with mobility relevance, e.g. for representing the data topic, the data provider or the data format. It is recommended that the metadata management of all National Access Points (NAPs) in Europe, or any other mobility data portals, considers this metadata specification in order to harmonise metadata descriptions across individual portals, and to ease the exchange of metadata in the mobility data ecosystem. Furthermore, this will ensure the basis for extended interoperability, among others with other NAPs or data portals.</p>

<p>This work has been carried out in the context of sub-working group 4.4 of the [[NAPCORE]] project. NAPCORE is an EU-cofunded Programme Support Action under the GRANT AGREEMENT No MOVE/B4/SUB/2020-123/SI2.852232. This Programme Support Action aims at supporting the implementation of Delegated Regulations under Directive 2010/40/EU regarding the requirements to make infrastructure, safety, traffic and travel data accurate and available to users such as transport authorities or service providers through National Access Points (NAPs). It will stimulate and accelerate the coordinated provision of ITS data through National Access Points to enhance the quality of services based on these data.</p>

<section id="scope-of-the-revision">

<h3>Scope of this version</h3>

<p>The objective of this work is to produce an initial release of mobilityDCAT-AP based on preceding preparatory activities, including a requirement analysis, a roadmap and conceptual models. A documentation about these preparatory activities is found at [[NAPCORE-Metadata-preparatory-activities]].</p>

<p>As [[DCAT-AP]], the Application Profile specified in this document is based on the specification of the <strong>Data Catalog Vocabulary</strong> (DCAT), originally  developed under the responsibility of the Government Linked Data Working Group [[GLD]] at W3C, and significantly revised in 2020 by the W3C Dataset Exchange Working Group [[DXWG]]. DCAT is an RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]] vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. Additional classes and properties from other well-known vocabularies are re-used where necessary.</p>

<p>The work does not cover implementation issues like mechanisms for exchange of data and expected behaviour of systems implementing the Application Profile other than what is defined in the Conformance Statement in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>.</p>

<p>The Application Profile is intended to facilitate data exchange and therefore the classes and properties defined in this document are only relevant for the data to be exchanged; there are no requirements for communicating systems to implement specific technical environments. The only requirement is that the systems can export and import data in RDF in conformance with this Application Profile.</p>

<section id="specification">

<h3>A DCAT-AP extension</h3>


<p>The mobilityDCAT-AP specification is designed as an extension of DCAT-AP in conformance with the guidelines for the creation of DCAT-AP extensions [[DCAT-AP-EG]]. The DCAT-AP Application Profile on which this document is based is the DCAT-AP specification version 2.0.1. of 8 June 2020 [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].  According to the same principles DCAT-AP is in itself an extension of DCAT.</p>

<p>This dependency must be taken into account while reading and using this specification. When implementing mobilityDCAT-AP, these specifications should be consulted first, to fill in any missing gaps in this document.</p>

<p>Comparing to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]], the following editions were made in mobilityDCAT-AP:</p>

<ul>
<li>some classes are newly created;</li>
<li>some obligation levels for existing classes in DCAT-AP are raised to higher levels;</li>
<li>some properties are added to existing classes in DCAT-AP, of which some are newly created;</li>
<li>some obligation levels for existing properties in DCAT-AP are raised to higher levels;</li>
<li>some existing, optional or recommended properties from DCAT-AP are removed;</li>
<li>some usage notes about existing classes and properties from DCAT-AP are refined to adress the special considerations in the context of mobility data portals;</li>
<li>some additional, existing controlled vocabalaries are refereneced;</li>
<li>some controlled vocabalaries are newly created.</li>
</ul>
<p>These removals of optional or recommended properties from DCAT-AP are meant to keep the vocabulary of mobilityDCAT-AP as small as possible, to avoid any mis-interpretations and multiple usage of properties among senders.</p>
<p>Further, some of the class and property additions correspond to the parallel DCAT-AP extension [[GEODCAT-AP-v2.0.0]], so there is a comaptibility between these two extensions in terms of class and property additions. </p>

<section id="terminology">

<h2>Terminology used in the Application Profile</h2>

<p>The following text is adapted from [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>

<p>An <strong>Application Profile</strong> is a specification that re-uses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used.</p>

<p>A <strong>Dataset</strong> is a collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats. In the context of mobility, this might be, e.g., a data collection about static parking information for truck driversIn the context of mobility, this might be, e.g., a data collection about static parking information for truck drivers, published by a road authority.</p>

<p>A <strong>Data Portal</strong> is a Web-based system that contains a data catalogue with descriptions of datasets and provides services enabling discovery and re-use of the datasets. </p>
<p>In the context of mobility, this might be a National Access Points adressing to the EC ITS Directive [[NAPCORE-NAPs]]. Accordingly, a NAP aims to "...facilitate access, easy exchange and reuse of transport related data, in order to help support the provision of EU-wide interoperable travel and traffic services to end users." It is realised as "...a database, data warehouse, data marketplace, repository, and register, web portal or similar...".  </p>

<p> In the context of NAPs, the terms "Metadata registry", "Metadata entry" and "Publication" are often used, which are explained next:</p>

<p>A <strong>Metadata registry</strong> is a A Metadata registry is a digital recording of all metadata entries in a data portal, each describing the administration, organisation, and content of individual publications, including the published data set and the corresponding distributions. The most visible Metadata representation are the dataset descriptions in a GUI of a NAP portal.</p>

<p>A <strong>Metadata entry</strong> (sometimes called metadata record or metadata set) describes the administration, organisation, and content of an individual publication, including the published data set and the corresponding distributions.</p>

<p>A <strong>Publication</strong> is an abstract construct that covers a dataset published by a data publisher and which has one or multiple distributions.</p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP (as well as DCAT-AP) is expressed as a RDF schema [[RDFS]]. A RDF schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. This is done via a class and property system.</p>

<p>A <strong>Class</strong> is a group of resources. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by IRIs and may be described using properties.</p>

<p>A <strong>Property</strong> is a relation between subject resources and object resources.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the core elements of the DCAT-AP data model, denoting how the above-mentioned terms and relations are expressed as classes and properties. This figure also shows, how NAP-related terms, such as publications, are related to this class and property structure.</p>


<p>In the following sections, classes and properties are grouped under headings ‘mandatory’, ‘recommended’ and ‘optional’. These terms have the following meaning, relating to potential responsibilities of metadata senders and metadata receivers.</p>

<p>Such metadata senders and receivers are important actors for interoperable metadata, i.e. whenever there is an exchange of metadata between IT systems. This may happen when there are metadata import and export functions in a data portal. In this case, metadata senders and receivers are other data portals, e.g., allowing harvesting of metadata. So, the following terms refer to the capability of a data portal to provide corresponding metadata in an export function, or to read them in an import function.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory class</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender MUST provide information about instances of the class.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended class</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender SHOULD provide information about instances of the class; a sender of data MUST provide information about instances of the class, if such information is available.</li>
<li><strong>Optional class</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender MAY provide the information but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MUST provide the information for that property.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender SHOULD provide information for that property; a sender MUST provide information for that property, if such information is available.</li>
<li><strong>Optional property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MAY provide the information for that property but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated class</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that class; a sender SHOULD NOT provide information about instances of that class.</li>
<li><strong>Deprecated property</strong>: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that property; a sender SHOULD NOT provide the information about instances of that propertry.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meaning of the terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY in this section and in the following sections are as defined in [[RFC2119]].</p>

<p>In the given context, the term "processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).</p>

<p>Classes are classified as ‘Mandatory’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-classes"></a> if they appear as the range of one of the mandatory properties in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a>.</p>

<p>All other classes are classified as ‘Optional’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#optional-classes"></a>. A further description of the optional classes is only included as a sub-section in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a> if the Application Profile specifies mandatory or recommended properties for them.</p>

<p>Classes no longer included in this version of the specification, or replaced with other ones, are classified as ‘Deprecated’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#deprecated-classes"></a>.</p>

<h2>Controlled Vocabularies</h2>

<section id="requirements-for-controlled-vocabularies">

<h3>Requirements for controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>The following is a list of requirements that were identified for the controlled vocabularies to be recommended in this Application Profile.</p>

<p>Controlled vocabularies SHOULD:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be published under an open licence.</li>
<li>Be operated and/or maintained by an institution of the European Union, by a recognised standards organisation or another trusted organisation.</li>
<li>Be properly documented.</li>
<li>Have labels in multiple languages, ideally in all official languages of the European Union.</li>
<li>Contain a relatively small number of terms (e.g. 10-25) that are general enough to enable a wide range of resources to be classified.</li>
<li>Have terms that are identified by URIs with each URI resolving to documentation about the term.</li>
<li>Have associated persistence and versioning policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>These criteria do not intend to define a set of requirements for controlled vocabularies in general; they are only intended to be used for the selection of the controlled vocabularies that are proposed for this Application Profile.</p>

</section>

<section id="controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used">

<h3>Controlled vocabularies to be used</h3>

<p>In the table below, a number of properties are listed with controlled vocabularies that MUST be used for the listed properties. The declaration of the following controlled vocabularies as mandatory ensures a minimum level of interoperability.</p>

<p>Compared with [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]], mobilityDCAT-AP makes use of additional controlled vocabularies. Some of these additional controlled vocabularies are maintained by external organisations, others are created and maintained by mobilityDCAT-AP.</p>
<p>Further, mobilityDCAT-AP is removing some recommended and properties from [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]], which are linked with controlled vocabularies. Thus, these controlled vocabularies are not relevant for mobilityDCAT-AP and not listed in the following table.</p>

<div data-include-format="html" data-include-replace="true" data-include="./tables/controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used.html"></div>

</section>

<section id="other-controlled-vocabularies">

<h3>Other controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>In addition to the proposed common vocabularies in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>, which are mandatory to ensure minimal interoperability, implementers are encouraged to publish and to use further region or domain-specific vocabularies that are available online. While those may not be recognised by general implementations of the Application Profile, they may serve to increase interoperability across applications in the same region or domain. Examples are the full set of concepts in EuroVoc [[?EUV-EUROVOC]], the CERIF standard vocabularies [[?CERIF-VOCS]], the Dewey Decimal Classification [[?DDC]] and numerous other schemes.</p>

<p>For geospatial metadata, the working group has identified the following additional vocabularies:</p>

<h3>Licence vocabularies</h3>

<p>Concerning licence vocabularies, implementers are encouraged to use widely recognised licences such as Creative Commons licences [[?CC]], and in particular the CC Zero Public Domain Dedication [[?CC0]] or CC-BY Attribution 4.0 International [[?CC-BY]], or  the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) [[?PDDL]].
Often there is applicable legislation or a licency policy in place which determine the set of licences to be used. They may recommend the use of an open government licence such as the UK Open Government Licence [[?UKOGL]].</p>

<p>Further activities in this area are undertaken by the Open Data Institute [[?ODI]] with the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary [[?ODRS]] and by the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) Initiative [[VOCAB-ODRL]].</p>

<p>In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a> MAY be provided.</p>

<p>Recommended and optional classes may have mandatory properties, but those only apply if and when an instance of such a class is present in a description.</p>

</section>

<section id="receiver-requirements">

<h2>Receiver requirements</h2>

<p>In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process information for all classes specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#classes"></a>.</li>
<li>Process information for all properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a>.</li>

<!-- Agent types, agent roles and agent properties; PL edits 03.07.23 -->

<section id="agent-roles" class="informative">

<h2>Agent Types, Agent Roles and Agent Properties</h2>

<p>According to [[FOAF]], an Agent (via class "foaf:Agent") may be of a type of a person (via sub-class "foaf:Person"), an organisation (via sub-class "foaf:Organization"), or a group (via sub-class "foaf:Group". </p>
<p>For mobility data portals, it is expected that organisations are the main data actors, so the type organisation SHOULD be used. A person MAY be explicetely mentioned as an agent. In this case, he or she SHOULD be attributed to an organisation via the property "org:memberOf", and, additionally, attributed with the personal name via properties "foaf:firstName" and "foaf:surname".</p>

<p>Further, [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]] has the following note about agent roles:</p>

<p>"The DCAT Application Profile specified in this document has a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset. The only such ‘agent role’ that can be expressed in the current version of the profile is through the property dct:publisher (http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher), defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”. A second property is available in the DCAT recommendation, dcat:contactPoint (http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#Property:dataset_contactPoint), defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using VCard”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.</p>

<p>In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles. In such cases, extensions to the base profile may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings. ..." </p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP specifies this note as follows:</p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP does not use the property "dcat:contactPoint" at all. Any contact details can be described as properties under class "foaf:Agent". As "dcat:contactPoint" is using the class "vcard:Kind" as the range, this class is neither used by mobilityDCAT-AP, but kept in the overview table of optional classes for compatibility reasons.</p>

<p>mobilityDCAT-AP uses the class "foaf:Agent" in the context of describing entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>responsible for the creation and maintenance of the data platform;</li>
<li>responsible for the creation and maintenance of a metadata entry;</li>
<li>responsible for the provisioning of a dataset; or</li>
<li>responsible for the content of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, two different agent-role properties are used: "dct:publisher" (already defined by [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]]); and "dct:rightsHolder" (added by mobilityDCAT-AP). In contrast, other agent-role properties such as "dct:creator" (defined by [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]]) are not used.</p>

<p>These specifications are meant to keep the agend-related vocabulary of mobilityDCAT-AP as small as possible, to avoid any mis-interpretations and multiple usage of properties among senders.</p>

<p>The class "foaf:Agent" is used to indentify the entity with the above-mentioned roles, as well as its contact details. </p>

<p>Thus, a couple of properties is defined, independently of the agent's role. Of these properties, "organisation name" and "email" are mandatory. The email SHOULD be used to establish a communication channel to the agent. Further, recommended or optional properties MAY used to provide further contact details, e.g. via the agent's web adress or the postal adress. </p>

<p>There is one further, recommended property "dct:type" describing the agent's type via a controlled vocabulary. This property MAY be used to determine, among others, the hierarchy of a public authority (local, regiona, national, supranational). Such organisation types are often data providers at mobility data portals, so such information is seen beneficialy.</p>

<p>However, the controlled vocabulary from [[ADMS-SKOS]], as proposed by [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]], is not sufficient in the mobility context. Thus, further items are added by mobilityDCAT-AP to the controlled vocabulary, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>. </p>

<p>All information about an agent, as described via such properties, MAY be linked to, or be part of the data portal's user registry, in case, e.g., users are required to sign in before they use the data portal.</p>

<!-- Conformance Test Results -->

<section id="conformance-test-results" class="informative">

<h2>Conformance Test Results</h2>

<p>Following ..., mobilityDCAT-AP supports the specification of test results to assess the degree of conformity of a resource (i.e., a Catalogue, a Dataset, a Data Service) with a given specification (e.g., a standard, a set of implementing rules, a set of data quality or interoperability criteria).</p>

<p>For this purpose, mobilityDCAT-AP makes use of two different but not mutually exclusive approaches. More precisely, property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> is used when the test result states that a resource is conformant with a given specification. The more general approach is based on [[PROV-O]], and it specifies conformance test results as a testing activity (<code>prov:Activity</code>) that generates a result (specified with property <code>prov:generated</code>), corresponding to one of the degrees of conformity defined in [[INSPIRE-MD-REG]], and available from the INSPIRE Registry [[INSPIRE-DoC]]. The specification against which the testing activity is carried out is specified via a &ldquo;qualified association&rdquo; (<code>prov:qualifiedAssociation</code>), linked to a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; (<code>prov:hadPlan</code>) derived from (<code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code>) the specification itself.</p>

<p>This pattern is illustrated in <a href="#ex-activity"></a>.</p>

<!-- Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects -->

<section id="accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects" class="informative">

<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties <code>dcat:mediaType</code> and <code>dct:format</code> provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>

<p><strong>Multilingual aspects</strong> related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. <code>rdfs:Literal</code>) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.</li>
<li>The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the <strong>language tag</strong> is mandatory. </p>

<p>Language tags to be used with <code>rdfs:Literal</code> are defined by [[BCP47]], which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in [[RFC6497]] with the field "t0" [[CLDR]] indicating a machine translation.</p>

<p>A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd".</p>

<p>For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.</p>

<p>For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation [[CONNEG]] mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.</p>

<p>All the occurrences of the property <code>dct:language</code>, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, must have a URI as their object, not a literal string from the [[ISO-639]] code list.</p>

<p>How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>

<section id='privsec'>

<h2>Privacy and security considerations </h2>

<p>The mobilityDCAT-AP vocabulary supports the attribution of data and metadata to various participants such as resource creators, publishers and other parties or agents, and as such defines terms that may be related to personal information. In addition, it also supports the association of rights and licenses with catalogued Resources and Distributions. These rights and licenses could potentially include or reference sensitive information such as user and asset identifiers as <a data-cite="VOCAB-ODRL#privacy-consideration">described</a> in [[VOCAB-ODRL]].</p>

<p>Implementations that produce, maintain, publish or consume such vocabulary terms must take steps to ensure security and privacy considerations are addressed at the application level.</p>
