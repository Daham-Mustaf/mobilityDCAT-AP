<th>Usage note</th>
<td>
<p>An annotation about any quality aspects regarding the delivered content, in particular methods, metrics/indicators and results of a quality assessment in the responsibility of the Data Owner.</p>
<p>There is a similar class "Quality Measurement" in [[GEODCAT-AP-v2.0.0]]. Both "Quality Annotation" are "Quality Measurement" are reusing the Data Quality Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DQV]]. Quality Measurement is referring to concrete metrics, like sub-types of spatial resulotions being used [[GEODCAT-AP-v2.0.0]]. At mobility data portals, however, the practice so far is to provide some free text about quality aspects. Thus, the Quality Annotation refers to an unspecified form of quality annotation, which MAY be a free text.</p>
