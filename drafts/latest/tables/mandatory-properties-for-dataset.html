<p>This property contains more information about the dataset as a brief, free-text description. It is used only for a brief overview, because free-text fields are unsuitable for searches, due to spelling mistakes, different wordings and other aspects. The categorisation and other aspects about the dataset are descrobed within other properties of the dataset. </p>
<p>This property can be repeated for parallel language versions of the description - see <a class="no-secRef" href="#accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects"></a>. The language versions should correspond to property <a href="#catalogue-record-language"><code>dct:language</code></a> of class Catalogue Record. I.e., if more than one language is provided as a metadata language, there should be as many language versions for the description.</p>

<p>This property links the dataset to an available distribution.</p> 
<p>In mobilityDCAT-AP, it is mandatory that each dataset has at least one distribution. Thus, the obligation of this property is raised to “mandatory”, compared to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>

<p>This property describes how often the delivered content is updated. This information tells a data comsumer, how often it is updated on the on the data platform, so the data comsumer might align the frequency of data retrieval accordingly. </p>
<p>For data services, e.g., data feeds, the frequency should correspond to the technical upload / data push frequency. For static data sets, it should correspond to the expected change frequency (see property "dct:modified"). The frequency might be a specific time interval, or a general remark such as “updated on occurrence”. </p>

  This property can be repeated if there are multiple languages in the Dataset - see <a class="no-secRef" href="#accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects"></a>. A controlled vocabulary <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a> is provided.</p>

<p>This property refers to an entity (company and person) that publishes the corresponding dataset. This entity is responsible for the provisioning of a dataset.

This entity is the direct contact for the platform operator or data consumers, who have questions or issues about the provisioning of a dataset.</p>
<p> This information can be natively created by a data platform, then corresponding to the entity that is registered to the data platform and has the role of a data publisher. This information can be also harvested from other portals. It should include, as a minimum, the name and email address of the entity. The information might be identical to the property <a href="#catalogue-record-publisher"><code>dct:publisher</code></a> of class Catalogue Record and/or <a href="#dataset-rights-holder"><code>dct:rightsHolder</code></a> of class Dataset. </p>

<p>This property refers to the category of the content, as delivered by a dataset. A dataset may be associated with multiple themes. A category is important for data seekers who are interested in a particular type of data content.</p>
<p>The category is described via a controlled vocabulary in two hierarchy levels: The 1st level is a mandatory field labeled "Data content category", describing the classification of the data content on an aggregated level. The 2nd level is an optional field labeled “Data content sub catagory”, concretising the "Data content category" via one or several sub-categories. When entering the metadata for one dataset, the data provider would first select one or several options of a "Data content category", and then optionally concretise this with one or more options of corresponding “Data content sub catagory”. The platform must be able to handle the dependencies between these two levels, i.e., match the allowed options between the 1st and 2nd level.</p>
<p>According to DCAT-AP, this property must further refer to a controlled vocabulary "Data Themes" by the Publications Office of the European Union [[EUV-THEMES]]. It is recommended to use this Controlled Vocabulary as a 3rd metadata field labeled "EU Open Data Theme". In most cases, it is assumed that the relevant value from this EU vocabulary is "Transport" [[EUV-THEMES-TRANSPORT]].</p>
<p>Altogether, there must be at least two values noted for this property: at least one from the controlled vocabulary of "Data content category" and one from the controlled vocabulary by the Publications Office. These controlled vocabularies <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a> are provided.</p>
<p>The obligation of this property is raised to “mandatory”, compared to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>  
<p>The subject of a dataset MAY also be described via a property <a href="#dataset-keyword"><code>dcat:keyword</code></a>. However, the usage of "theme / category" is preferred, to avoid ambiguity and uncontrolled theme descriptions.</p>
