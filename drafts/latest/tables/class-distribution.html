<th>Usage note</th>
<td>
<p>A distribution describes the data formats and communication methods for a dataset. There may be one or multiple distributions for one dataset. For example, the same data set (e.g. static parking information for truck drivers) can be provided in different ways e.g. as downloadable zip file or as XML using a SOAP web service. These are two distributions based on one data set.</p>
<p>in [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]], this class has been classified as ‘Recommended’, to allow for cases that a particular Dataset does not have a Distribution, i.e. . However, for the context of mobility data portals, it can be expected that all datasets have one or more Distributions. Thus, the obligation of class Distribution is raised to mandatory, comparing to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>
